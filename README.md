Hello there! In this repository you can find some of the C# scripts that I have created for my projects!

All of the example scripts are created by me for either my own projects or univerity project.

### [Friday Night Funkin' Reimagined](https://github.com/Patapl2/Code-Examples/tree/main/FridayNightFunkin'%20Reimagined)
* A fan remake of the popular web rhythm game "Friday Night Funkin'" which was originally developed in the HaxeFlixel engine. This remake is built from the ground up in the Unity engine, with the original's mechanics faithfully recreated & new music and visuals added. Players must time the press of the arrow keys to match the beat of the music, in epic battles against musical foes! The game's mechanics are similar to other popular rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero, where the player's timing and accuracy determine their success.

### [The Garden] 
* A survival-horror gameplay demo where the player is a shrunken-down human navigating their way through a giant garden environment to find their way back home. Using their size to their advantage, they must avoid the dangerous predators of the garden (beware of the spiders!). Tension is built through the player's helplessness and terror at the giant insects that are up close and personal, no longer squashable by boot! The story follows the player's growth (emotionally and physically) as they overcome the obstacles and challenges of the garden.

### [Sewer Stuart] 
* An endless runner with procedural tunnels and an alarming amount of cheese. Run from the impending wave of water as Stuart, a rat who just want to peacefully eat his cheese! There will be a lot of obstacles in the way, but luckily there are a lot of magical powerups and discarded treasures to help Stuart go on!

### [Escape the Sub VR] 
* A virtual reality escape-room-like experience where the player takes on the role of a secret agent stranded on an abandoned submarine that is stuck at the bottom of the ocean. The game features a variety of puzzles & obstacles to overcome using unique interaction methods only possible in VR. Oh, and don't be alarmed by the noises you hear. It's probably just the pet chicken the bad guys left behind.
